## Blockchain
A blockchain – originally block chain – is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network.

### Scope
Scope of this project is to implement the blockchain as logic and nothing more than that. Although I would try to expose functionalities that can be used to build things on top of this project. Pieces in blockchain:
1. Blocks - Records having data
2. Consensus - Longest chain rule
3. Proof-of-work - Computation logic which validates the transaction

## Requirement
Node.js - v6.9.5
